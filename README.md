# wadi

Web Assembly Device Interface (`wadi`) is a complementary specification for `wasi` hosts that want to offer device drivers. Users may wish to extend/reduce the capabilities of the host environment at startup or runtime. This spec helps standadize the means by which `wasi` can communicate with device backed files.
